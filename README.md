# Item value mod creator
This Java repository contains code that writes the Item_value_mod for the game Stonehearth.  

For the mod itself, please see the [Item_value_mod](https://github.com/Xynariz/Item_value_mod).

The code in this repository has several very particular requirements.  When the code is more complete, I will post a list of exactly what is needed to run this code.
